# Mass Shootings in the USA Shiny Dashboard 

This dashboard provides descriptive analysis about mass shooting in the United States since 1982. 
The data comes from the 
[Mother Jonesâ€™ Investigation](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/) 
about mass shootings in the USA.

It's possible to obtain summary statistics filtering the data by date and number of fatalities involved in each attack. 
The dashboard is organized in five tabs that are described below.

## Tab 1 : Geographic Location 

This tab provides a general insight about the location and number of victims regarding mass shootings having taken place between the selected dates. 
The map has been build using the [`leaet` package](http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/).
